1. Create a class called "Rectangle" with the following properties:
 private float "length"
 private float "width"
2. Implement a constructor that takes the length and width as parameters and
initializes the corresponding properties.
3. Create a method called "CalculateArea" that calculates and returns the area of the
rectangle (length * width).
4. Create an instance of the "Rectangle" class, set the length to 4.5 and the width to
3.2. Call the "CalculateArea" method and print out the result.
